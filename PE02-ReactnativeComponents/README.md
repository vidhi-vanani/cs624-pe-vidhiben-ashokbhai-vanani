# Reactnative Components

## Input  
The CoreComponents application starts with the user entering their favourite course in a simple text box. An image from `./assets` was loaded and displayed to give the application a branded feel (icon.png). In the input box, users could type any MSCS course code or name like CS624.

## Process  
The application is made in React Native with TypeScript. Core components being used in the app include virtualized View, Text, ScrollView, Image, TextInput, and StyleSheet. Full-length scroll is kept very user-friendly for scrolling the full course list. The courses are grouped into 3 categories: 8 Core Requirements, 2 Depth of Study courses, and 1 Capstone. Internal styles are used for padding, colours, and layout, creating a clean and readable UI.

## Output  
The app fills up a mobile screen having the logo at the top, text box course input, and down of this input box is the scrollable course list. The courses are styled and grouped by type, making it readable and comprehensible. The final output is very simple, clean, and interactive for the user, providing a mobile app-like feel where the users can actively explore MSCS program courses.
