## Cities App

## Input
Users can input `country` and `currency` information through this application. Simple country and currency form titles include an official currency, forming a tailor-made list of countries. While originally this might have gone through a cities-based version of the app during the `Hands-On Session (HOS)`, the focus of this `Programming Exercise (PE)` went entirely toward gaining a deeper understanding and enhancing the functionality of working with country and currency data.

## Process
Submitting the form assigns a unique identifier to each country entry through uuid and stores it in the application's state along with the currency. The user can view all the saved `countries` on the list and tap on any country to see further details. This mimics the structure, style, and interaction of the original cities app - only this has cemented country data-focused logic. The original components are then reused and adapted to manage state appropriately and allow for fluid screen navigation. 

## Output
The interface is neat, responsive, and displays a scrollable list of `countries` with their `currencies`. This is an organized way to manage country information, reflecting real-world data management and component reuse lessons learned from the PE.
